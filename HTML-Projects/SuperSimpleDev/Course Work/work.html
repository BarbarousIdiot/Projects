<p>Linux Kernel was created by Linus Torvalds in 1992 while
    he was still in College. He created this becuase he wasn't
    having a good time using Mimix(another Unix Based Operating System)
    . So he decided to create his own and opted GNU for the operating
    system. Linux Kernel is based on UNIX. In GNU/Linux based operating Systems
    , the GNU is the OS and the kernel is Linux.

<p>GNU/Linux based operating Systems are way better than the other
    operating Systems in the market right now such as , Microsoft
    Windows, MacOS, ChromeOS, etc. Microsoft Windows dominates the
    computer market although it is the worst operating system ever made.
    It wasn't bad but instead amazing until Windows 10 came out. We'll get there
    in a while.

<p> How to actually start using Linux</p>
<p>Well for starters, you don't go and type 'Download Linux'
    or something like that instead we install Linux Based operating Systems
    or Linux Distributions(distros for short). The most popular Linux distro
    especially for noobs is Linux Mint. Linux Mint is an amazing Linux Distro which
    has the Cinnamon Desktop. I use Linux Mint too(i'm not a noob tho).
